# TODO: Fix Header Background Transition Glitch

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Modify `src/components/header/header.css` to adjust menu background transition timing to prevent interference with header transition on close.
- [x] Test the menu open/close animation to confirm the glitch is resolved.
- [ ] If needed, add `will-change` property or fine-tune transition durations for better performance.
